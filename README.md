# Simulation Automation Tool
The Opportunistic Network Environment simulator.
This project provides a user-friendly GUI to automate a simulation software. It eliminates manual editing of configuration files, generates reports, and allows users to download them. Built using PyQt5 and web technologies, it streamlines simulation workflows for faster results.

## Features

- **Dynamic File Handling**: Load, view, and edit configuration files directly from the GUI.
- **Report Generation**: Automatically generate and download simulation reports.
- **Seamless Integration**: Combines Python, HTML, and CSS for a polished user experience.
- **Cross-Platform**: Runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
